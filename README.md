# ElasticSearch
We have used Elasticsearch server based on Lucene to perform the search on a dataset. This is helpful to search the data which is stored in indexed form by tokenizing the words.
Elasticsearch is fast and efficient as compared to the traditional RDBMS.

##Logstash
Logstash is used to parse the csv into the elasticsearch easily. It aso helps to monitor any changes in the file and updates the records in the elasticsearch.

### Usage
For using it we just need to import dataset into elasticsearch using logstash and implement the search on the particular column.
This dummy code will provide the help to implement your search instantly.
